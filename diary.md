# Reactor Diary

Wrestling with whether to attempt to use libraries for all the parsers, or
whether to have a go at writing "parsers" that extract dependencies via regular
expressions, but I'm leaning toward the dependency heavy route. If I do go that
route, then I imagine I'm going to want to break the project up into a core
reactor project and dependencies.
